> Q: In which layer do `ping` and `traceroute` work?
A: Internet Control Message Protocol or **ICMP**.

<!--more-->

The **ICMP** is one of the main protocols of the [Internet Protocol Suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite).  Unlike the transport protocols such as TCP and UDP, it is not typically used to exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications.

**ICMP** is used by network devices, like routers, to send messages to indicate whether a host or a service is available or not.  It is also utilized by some diagnostic tools like `ping` and `traceroute`.

## Compiler
A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting a source code is to create an executable program.

## Interpreter
In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly **executes**  instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:

- parse the source code and perform its behavior directly.
- translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this.
- explicitly execute stored precompiled code made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.

## Compiler vs Interpreter

Whether execute the command is the biggest difference between an interpreter and a compiler. Refer the following chart for more comparisons.

| Field | Compiler  | Interpreter |
| :--: | :--------: | :--------:|
|**Input**| Entire program  | Single instruction |
|**Execution**| No  | Yes |
|**Intermediate Object**| Yes | No |
|**Conditional Statement**| faster | slower |
|**Memory**| More | Less |
|**Compile**| Not every time | Every time |
|**Errors (if any)**|After entire program | For every instruction |
|**Example**| C Compiler | BASIC |
